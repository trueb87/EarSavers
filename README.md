Ear Savers Distribution Manual
===============================

Purpose
-----------
The purpose of this document is a manual of 3d printing and distributing "Ear Savers". Ear Savers are a flexable piece of plastic with hooks to attach masks
to to make long shifts of wearing PPE more comfortable.

Finding a Design
----------------------
There are a ton of great designs out there. I When picking a design I would look for The following things
1. Adjustability, more than one size hook for masks to fit different sized people
2. Flatter is better, Flat designs print faster than taller ones
3. ability to fit more onto your print surface

I have came across the following designs which work well
1. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4249415 With this design I can fit 11 on my Prusa MK3S print bed. This design is not for commercial use.
2. https://3dprint.nih.gov/discover/3dpx-013410 This design has been released into the public domain, cannot get as many as in 1. but more flexible with the license.

Printing
-----------------
### Material
The prefered material for most PPE is PETG. This material is less brittle and behaves better with temperature fluctuations

### Print Settings
I find that a 0.2 layer height is a good compromise for speed and quality. There should be no infill with these designs and support should not be required

### Stockpile
Before you start to advertise that you are giving these away, be sure you have a good stockpile. 
I recommend having at least 100 on hand before you start to advertise.

Working in Teams
-----------------
You can work in teams and have multiple pickup locations across town. Have all the requests filed into one place and have multiple people filling these requests

Managing Requests
---------------------
You may get a lot of requests for earsavers. I recommend creating a Google Form that outputs the requests to a spread sheet. Ask for the following things:
1. Their name
2. How many they want
3. Email address they can be reached at
4. Why they want these, or what they do for Work - I use this to help determine need and priority. 
5. If they want information on donating - I like to ask them here. When I email them later I will either add a section on donating or not. In this difficult time, I do not want to guilt anyone into donating, so I only ask them once.
6. If you are working in teams, you can ask where they would like to pick up these from

Advertising
-----------
Now that you have a design, and started to print them, and have a way of managing requests, let's let people know you have them.

Advertise in your local area using such tools as
1. Facebook - If your area has a local facebook group, you can advertise there
2. Nextdoor - Great place to get ahold of people near you
3. Craigs List - Many people know about it and use it every day.
4. With every order I send out, I include a card with a QR code to my web form so they can request more

In each of these places I recommend you do not give them an email address or use their built in messaging system. 
Give them a link to your google form and have them fill it out. This will help you better keep track of the requests.

To avoid being bombareded all at once with a ton of requests for ear savers. I recomenda only one location is advertized at a time. For example, Post on Facebook Market place first. You will get an inrush of orders, but once they slow down and you have replinished your stock, and advertize on Nextdoor, repeat until you have no where left to advertise.

Donations
----------
Many people want to support what you are doing and pay for the ear savers. I recommend you have a plan in place to deal with this. Some ideas are:
1. Support other causes you want to support
2. Have them give you money
3. Ask them to pay it forward

Filing Orders
-------------
Got your first order for Ear Savers? Great! Place ear savers in a zip-lock bag. Write the requester's name on the bag and place the bag in a place accessible to the individual.
I placed a gray bin in front of my garage. I placed the ear Savers in the bin.

You can choose to sanitize the ear savers or not. Be sure to let the recipient know what steps you have or have not taken.

Next you will need to let the individual know where to pick up the ear savers. I used the following message in my email.

> Hi <Name>, I have your ear savers ready
>
> You can pick them up at my house at:
> Pick up address
> City, State Zip
>
> I have placed a gray plastic bin in front of my garage, inside the bin you will find a ziplock bag with your name on it.
>
> I included about 12 of them. As a disclaimer, even though I keep a clean environment when making these, do not assume these are sanitized. Please sanitize these in an appropriate manner.
>
> To donate there are three ways:
>
> 1) You can donate what you think it is worth to my paypal account <paypal account> My guideline is about <Reasonable amount> for every 10. Feel free to donate what you think it is worth though. Anything extra above my own expense will be donated to other charities once this is all over with.
>
> 2) Alternatively, you can donate to <Cause you want to support>
>
> 3) I want to discourage leaving cash as even when there is not a pandemic cash is kind of gross when you think about it. If this is your only means, I ask you to put them in a ziplock bag or envelope so I can quarantine it for a couple days.
>
> Stay healthy!
